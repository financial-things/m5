m5 - a toy compiler for a Pascal like language. 

It is build with lex/yacc and generates an abstract syntax tree, which can then be walked to generate code. Right now it only generates an pseudo m68k like assembler. It was originally intended to create standalone code for PalmOS. There is a test script in the test directory.
